# Height Stream example

Example of using hypersync-client to stream blockchain height updates in real-time.

This example demonstrates how to:
- Create a height stream using `client.streamHeight()`
- Handle different types of events (Height, Connected, Reconnecting)
- Monitor blockchain height changes as they occur
- Properly clean up the stream when done

Can run `pnpm start` to run it.
